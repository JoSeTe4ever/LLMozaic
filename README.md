## Getting Started

  

### Prerequisites

  

Before you can start using Mosaic, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place (for a local installation):

  

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

- Node 18 installed on your system.

- Npm 9.3 or higher installed on your system.

- Access to the Nylas API key and clientId by using a Nylas Sandbox.

- Access to the openAI API key.

  

### Installation

  

1. Clone the Mosaic repository to your local machine:

  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JoSeTe4ever/LLMozaic
```

  

2. Navigate to the project directory:

  

```bash
cd LLMozaic
```

  

3. Install the required dependencies in the different folders (backend, backend_node, frontend)):

  

for backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

for frontend

```bash
npm install
```

for backend_node

```bash
npm install
```

  

1. Configure Nylas API keys by creating a .env file with the first 4 values to be filled:

```bash
OPEN_API_KEY= #This is the openAI key
NYLAS_CLIENT_ID= #This can be obtained from a sandbox app in Nylas https://dashboard.nylas.com/applications/bpubuit9iv9zcoxgubqniinji/quickstart-guides
NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET= #This can be obtained from a sandbox app in Nylas https://dashboard.nylas.com/applications/bpubuit9iv9zcoxgubqniinji/quickstart-guides
NYLAS_API_SERVER=https://api.nylas.com
FLASK_APP=server.py
```

  
Once these two .env files have been filled, you are ready to start Mosaic locally. You have two options

1. Start Mosaic, you can use docker-compose :
```bash
docker-compose up
```
Open a browser with the following link http://localhost:1025/



2. Another option to start Mosaic, is to open 3 tabs, go to the proper folder, and for each one run:
```bash
frontend npm run start
backend_node npm run start
backend python server.py
```
  Open a browser with the following link http://localhost:3000
