## Inspiration

The inspiration for Mosaic came from the ever-growing need to manage digital communication more effectively. We realized that individuals, be they busy professionals or entrepreneurs, often struggle with email overload, manual calendar management, and keeping track of contacts. Inspired by advancements in AI and APIs like Nylas, we set out to create a tool that could streamline these tasks and boost productivity. The words of Demis Hassabis, Co-Founder and CEO of DeepMind, further motivated us. He emphasized the future of systems increasingly interacting through language, and we saw this as a calling to create Mosaic.

## What it does

Mosaic is a cutting-edge AI-powered virtual assistant designed to make your life easier by managing your emails, calendar, and contacts. By leveraging technologies like Nylas API, Langchain, and OpenAI GPT-4, Mosaic allows you to interact with your virtual assistant either by typing or speaking your requests. It offers intelligent categorization of emails, seamless calendar scheduling, and efficient contact organization.

## How we built it

Mosaic is a web application built using a combination of different technologies:

- **Backend (Node.js)**: Utilizes Nylas API to fetch and manage email, calendar, and contact data.
- **Backend (Python)**: Incorporates Langchain Framework and OpenAI API to process natural language queries and tasks.
- **Frontend (React)**: Provides an intuitive user interface.
- **Nginx Proxy**: Routes incoming web traffic to appropriate services.

We used Docker Compose to manage these services and ensure smooth interaction between them.

## Challenges we ran into

- **API Integration**: Making sure the Nylas API and OpenAI API worked in harmony was a technical challenge.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Fine-tuning the GPT-4 model to understand and execute tasks in a seamless way.
- **Security**: Ensuring that email and calendar data are accessed securely.
- **User Experience**: Creating an intuitive and easy-to-use interface.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- **Seamless Interaction**: Achieved smooth interaction between multiple services.
- **AI Integration**: Successfully integrated GPT-4 for natural language processing.
- **User Experience**: Built a user-friendly interface that even allows for voice commands.
- **Video Tutorial**: Created a comprehensive video to guide users through Mosaic's functionalities.

## What we learned

- We gained insights into the power and limitations of AI in automating daily tasks.
- We learned the intricacies of working with APIs like Nylas and OpenAI.
- The project taught us about building scalable and modular web applications.

## What's next for Mosaic Virtual Assistant

- **Memory Functionality**: Introduce a feature where Mosaic can remember past interactions for better service.
- **Multi-language Support**: To make Mosaic accessible to a broader audience.
- **Mobile App**: Extend the service to mobile platforms for on-the-go access.
- **Integration with More Services**: Like Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc., to become a more comprehensive virtual assistant.
